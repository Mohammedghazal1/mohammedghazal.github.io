             <h1>This is my developer story</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>When I was 14 years old I had a chance to use my dad’s laptop..</li>
        <li>In high school I was able to use the computers at our school library</li>
        <li>Then, I wanted to learn how computers, softwares, and web pages work. </li>
        <li>I enjoy learning typing from games</li>
        <li>I personally did not have any background interested in coding or developing</li>
        <li>With Refcode, I will learn how to build my first website, and know how to code, which for me is the most valuable experience that I will gain.</li>
